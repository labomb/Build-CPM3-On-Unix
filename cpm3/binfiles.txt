CP/M 3
======

  This archive contains an almost complete build of CP/M 3.


Differences from Digital Research CP/M 3
========================================

  All the CP/M 3 patches that DRI released have been applied to the
source code, except those to INITDIR. Patches 1-18 (except numbers 5
and 9) were applied. See INITDIR note below re. patches 5 and 9.

  CP/M 3 is now fully Year 2000 compliant. This affects the programs 
DATE.COM, DIR.COM and SHOW.COM.

  Dates can be displayed in US, UK or Year-Month-Day format. This is set by 
SETDEF:

      SETDEF [US]
      SETDEF [UK]
      SETDEF [YMD]  respectively.
  
  The CCP has a further bug fix: A command sequence such as:

  C1
  :C2
  :C3

  will now not execute the command C3 if the command C1 failed.


INITDIR
===============

  DRI (or Caldera) never released source level patches for INITDIR.COM.
However, two binary patches were released... patch #5 and patch #9. The
initdir.pat file included with this distribution provides details about
each of these patches and how to apply them.

  Should you wish to use the INITDIR command in your CP/M environment, you
should consider applying both of these patches to the binary beforehand.
